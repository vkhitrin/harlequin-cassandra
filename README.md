This is a [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) adapter for [Harlequin](https://harlequin.sh).  
It is based on [Datastax' cassandra-driver](https://github.com/datastax/python-driver).

## Integration With Harlequin

Cassandra doesn't use cursor(s), thus `HarlequinCursor` and `HarlequinConnection`
behave differently in this adapter.  
Some quirks are to be expected.
